# Backgound

As I have a background in e-commerce, I wanted to explore more oppurtunities in the data world that would apply to my skill set. On my quest to better understand SQL, I came acrosss ðŸ“š[Luke Barousse's SQL Course](https://youtu.be/7mz73uXD9DA?si=HshQubg7HKKhw2fi) on Youtube where I aquired the dataset for this project.

The data consists of international information on job postings in the data world including:

- Job Location
- Job Titles
- Salaries
- Essential Skills
- and many more ðŸ˜„

### Our goal was to use SQL queries to answer the following questions

1. What are the top-paying Data Analyst roles from 2023?
2. What skills are required for the top paying Business/Data Analyst roles?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for Business/Data Analyst roles?
4. What are the top skills based on salary?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn (high-paying AND in-demand)?

# Tools I Used

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query and glean insight from the data
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management source, it's a common and powerful relational database system
- **Visual Studio Code:** My essential IDE for most of my coding projects
- **Git & Github:** A perfect place to share my code with others as well as maintain version control

# The Analysis

Each query in the project investigated a different issue or aspect of the job market. Here's how I approached each question:

### Top Highest Paying Jobs for Data Analysts (Locally/Remote)

First, I filtered jobs by yearly salary, focusing on remote and local (Georgia in this case) locations.This query highlights the top-paying oppurtunities for Data Analysts, which offers insight into what skills are trending in the industry.

```sql
SELECT
  job_id,
  job_title,
  job_location,
  job_schedule_type,
  salary_year_avg,
  job_posted_date,
  name AS company_name
FROM
  job_postings_fact
  LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
  job_title_short in ('Data Analyst', 'Business Analyst')
  AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
  AND job_location in ('Anywhere', 'Atlanta, GA', 'Georgia')
ORDER BY
  salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT
  10;
```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range:** The top 10 salaries of data/business analyst roles in 2023 ranged from $200,000 to $650,000. This offers not only a wide range but a high base salary potential to job seekers.
